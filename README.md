Unsupervised image classification

We had 2 months to develop an algorithm, my team won **first place**.
**Mozgalo documentation.pdf** is documentation for our whole approach and algorithm.

The main idea was to make model assembly and find which clusters of images are always together it the same class, then use that information to train a supervised model.

## About competition
[Mozgalo](https://www.estudent.hr/category/natjecanja/mozgalo/) is first and only student competition in the Republic of Croatia to undertake a deep analysis of large amounts of data and to create a Big Data solution.

Through its solutions, students find useful knowledge and information from large amounts of structured or unstructured data. They use different statistical methods, machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence. The aim is to encourage students to analyze analytical thinking, prediction and independently develop creative solutions to real problems with the help of computer science, statistics, econometrics and mathematics. Students develop their communication and business skills, teamwork and connect with many companies, primarily from the IT and banking sectors. During the competition, educational lectures, workshops are held, and participants are provided with mentoring and online educational content. All students from Croatian universities and polytechnics can participate in teams of two to four people.

Deep data analysis and predictive models are the basis of successful business operations of many industries, and this area can be considered as an interest in the future.
