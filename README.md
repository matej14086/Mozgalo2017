# Mozgalo2017
Unsupervised image classification
Mozgalo is biggest Croatian data science/ machine learning competiton. 
We had 2 months to develop an algorithm, my team won **first place**.
**Mozgalo documentation.pdf** is documentation for our whole approach and algorithm.

The main idea was to make model assembly and find which clusters of images are always together it the same class, then use that information to train a supervised model.
